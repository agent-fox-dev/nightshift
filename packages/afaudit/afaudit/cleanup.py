"""Audit file cleanup and retention utilities.

Provides :func:`purge_stale_audit_files` for best-effort removal of
ephemeral audit files at startup, and :func:`enforce_file_retention` for
deleting the oldest audit run file sets beyond a configured maximum.

Migrated from ``afcore.workspace.audit_cleanup`` (purge) and the
file-only half of the former ``enforce_audit_retention`` (retention).
The DB-retention half remains in the afcore package.

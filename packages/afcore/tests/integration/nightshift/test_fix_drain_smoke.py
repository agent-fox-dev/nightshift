"""Integration smoke test: fix-pipeline drain loop end-to-end.

Test Spec: TS-125-SMOKE-1
Requirements: 125-REQ-2.4, 125-REQ-3.3

Verifies the fix-pipeline stream works through the full drain loop from
build_streams -> DaemonRunner -> EngineWorkStream -> NightShiftEngine._drain_issues
-> _run_issue_check -> _process_fix, with a real engine, real streams, and a real
DaemonRunner.  FixPipeline.process_issue is mocked to return FixMetrics.

"""Command allowlist enforcement for shell commands.

Restricts which commands the coding agent can execute via the Bash tool.
Provides a default allowlist of standard development commands and supports
customization through configuration.

In addition to checking the leading command name against an allowlist, the
module rejects commands that contain shell operators (pipes, semicolons,
subshells, redirects, etc.) which would allow invoking arbitrary commands
behind an allowed leading token.

Requirements: 06-REQ-8.1, 06-REQ-8.2, 06-REQ-8.3, 06-REQ-9.1, 06-REQ-9.2

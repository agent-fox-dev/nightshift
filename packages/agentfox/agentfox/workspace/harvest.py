    Always uses ``git merge --squash`` to produce a single commit on
    dev_branch, regardless of the feature branch topology.

    Steps:
    1. Check if the feature branch has new commits relative to
       dev_branch. If not, return an empty list (no-op).
    2. Checkout dev_branch in the main repo.
    3. Squash-merge the feature branch (single commit, no merge commit).
    4. On conflict, spawn the merge agent to resolve.
    5. If ``push=True``, push develop to origin inside the lock.
    6. Return the list of changed files.

    Args:
        force_clean: When True, remove divergent untracked files instead
            of raising IntegrationError. Defaults to False.
        push: When True (default), push develop to origin inside the
            merge lock after a successful merge. When False, skip the
            push (pre-fix behavior). Requirements: 121-REQ-5.1, 121-REQ-5.2

    when their on-disk content is identical to the branch version.

    If any conflicting untracked file has content that differs from the
    branch version (i.e. local work not yet committed), the function
    raises IntegrationError rather than silently destroying that work —

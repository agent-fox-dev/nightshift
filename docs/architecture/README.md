# Architecture Guide

This guide describes the internal architecture of agent-fox. It is written for
engineers who want to understand how the system works before reading the source
code. The documents stay at the conceptual level — no code snippets, no method
signatures, no class hierarchies. For API details, consult the source under
`agent_fox/`. For configuration specifics, see the
[configuration reference](../config-reference.md). For archetype details,
see [Part 3](03-execution-and-archetypes.md#agent-archetypes).

## Architectural Principles

Several design principles run through the entire system:

**Specs are contracts, not suggestions.** All work traces back to structured
specifications. Agents that deviate from specs are caught by review agents
before their code lands. This front-loads the human judgment and lets the
machine execute without improvisation.

**Planning is deterministic.** Given the same specs and configuration, the
planner produces the same task graph. There is no LLM inference in the
planning phase. The human can inspect the plan, predict what will happen,
and trust the execution order.

**The orchestrator is deterministic.** The orchestrator itself makes zero LLM
calls. Every dispatch, retry, and escalation decision is based on rules and
thresholds. LLM work happens inside sessions; the orchestrator only manages
them.

**Isolation by default.** Each coding session runs in its own git worktree on
its own feature branch. Multiple agents work simultaneously without stepping
on each other. Integration happens through a serializing merge lock.

**Separation of concerns through archetypes.** Six archetype entries (Coder,
Reviewer, Curator, Verifier, Gate, Maintainer) with a mode system divide
labor. The Reviewer archetype covers three distinct review roles (pre-review,
drift-review, audit-review) through modes that override injection points and
tool allowlists. Review modes cannot modify code. The Curator and Verifier
chain as sequential post-implementation quality gates. The Gate archetype
handles lightweight checkpoint verification. Implementation agents cannot
skip quality checks.

**Graceful degradation everywhere.** Every component handles failure
non-fatally. If knowledge retrieval fails, the session proceeds without
knowledge context. If knowledge ingestion fails, the session outcome is
unaffected. The knowledge system never blocks the coding session lifecycle.

## Document Map

The architecture is documented in six parts that follow the user's workflow.

### [Part 1: Spec Authoring and Spec Structure](01-spec-authoring.md)

How human intent enters the system. Covers the spec artifact model
(PRD, requirements, test spec, tasks, optional architecture), the traceability
chain between them, task groups and dependency declarations, spec discovery,
the validation pipeline, severity model, auto-fixers, and the lint command.

### [Part 2: Planning — From Specs to Task Graphs](02-planning.md)

How specs become an executable plan. Covers the four-phase graph construction
(base nodes, archetype injection, tag overrides, cross-spec edges),
topological sort with deterministic tie-breaking, fast mode, file impact
analysis, ready task ordering, graph persistence, runtime patching, and
hot-load discovery.

### [Part 3: Execution, Session Lifecycle, and Agent Archetypes](03-execution-and-archetypes.md)

How the plan is carried out. Covers the orchestrator's dispatch loop, the
four-phase session lifecycle (prepare, execute, harvest, assess), context
assembly with three knowledge retrieval categories, the six-entry archetype
registry with mode system (coder, reviewer, curator, verifier, gate,
maintainer), multi-instance convergence strategies, retry handling, workspace
isolation, merge integration, sync barriers, and reset.

### [Part 4: Night-Shift Mode](04-night-shift.md)

How the system maintains itself. Covers the fix-only daemon, batch triage
with dependency and supersession detection, the three-stage fix pipeline,
in-memory spec construction, drain behavior, cost limits, and staleness
detection.

### [Part 5: Knowledge System Architecture](05-knowledge-system-architecture.md)

How the system remembers. Covers the `KnowledgeProvider` protocol, the
three-category retrieval pipeline (review findings, cross-group findings,
same-spec summaries), the closed-loop finding lifecycle
(create → inject → supersede), session summary storage, the DuckDB-backed
knowledge store, the quality assurance layer (review findings, drift findings,
multi-instance convergence), and the audit trail.

### [Part 6: Spec Format v1.3](06-spec-format-v13.md)

The JSON-based spec format. Covers the v1.3 file structure (JSON artifacts
validated by `afspec`), PRD frontmatter and lifecycle states, the parsing
pipeline that maps `afspec` models to agent-fox types, context assembly and
rendering, validation, and the verification checklist.
